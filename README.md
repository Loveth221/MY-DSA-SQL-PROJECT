# DSA DATA ANALYSIS CAPSTONE PROJECT


## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project explores real-world sales

and operations data from Kultra Mega store(KMS)

a retail company headquater in Lagos, Nigeria

specialises in office supplies and furnitures.

As a Business inteligence Analyst supporting the

Abuja division, KMS order data (2009-2012) was 

reguested to analysed the data and present key 

insight and findings and provide actionable 

recommendations.

The case study featured typical business scenerios,

from identifying top customers and sales trends to 

evaluating cost efficiency in logistics. Queries were

written and executed in SQL Server, covering both sales

performance and operational decisions.

simulated order data(2009-2012) from Kultra Mega Store(KMS). It 

includes sales, categories, shipping method, product category, 

regions, and order priorities. The data was shared in Excel format

and analysed using SQL Server.

## TOOLS USED

 - SQL Server Management Studio
   (SSMS)
 - SQL (Aggregation, Grouping,
   Subqueries, Joins)
 - Github ( Project documentation)

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION

 - The data set was first reviewd and cleaned in Excel, where duplicate

   reccords were checked and none was found, the file was saved to CSV

   UTF-8 Format.

 - A new database was created in SQL Server Management Studio(SSMD)
  
   using SQL querries, after which the cleaned Excel file was imported.

 - During the import process appropriate data type were assigned to
  
   columns as needed. NULL values were permitted for three specific

   columns to preserve data integrity and flexibility during querries.

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

  The Kultra Mega stores inventory Dataset was explore(Structured Querry
  
  Language) to answer and draw insights from some questions such as:

  case scenerios 1: Sales and regional performance

   - which product category has the highest sales?
