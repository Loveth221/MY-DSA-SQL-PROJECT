details about the KMS case study project.


# DSA DATA ANALYSIS CAPSTONE PROJECT


## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project explores real-world sales

and operations data from Kultra Mega store(KMS)

a retail company headquater in Lagos, Nigeria

specialises in office supplies and furnitures.

As a Business inteligence Analyst supporting the

Abuja division, KMS order data (2009-2012) was 

reguested to analysed the data and present key 

insight and findings and provide actionable 

recommendations.

The case study featured typical business scenerios,

from identifying top customers and sales trends to 

evaluating cost efficiency in logistics. Queries were

written and executed in SQL Server, covering both sales

performance and operational decisions.

## DATA SOURCE

The dataset was provided by the DSA Incubator Hub and contains

simulated order data(2009-2012) from Kultra Mega Store(KMS). It 

includes sales, categories, shipping method, product category, 

regions, and order priorities. The data was shared in Excel format

and analysed using SQL Server.

## TOOLS USED

 - SQL Server Management Studio
   (SSMS)
 - SQL (Aggregation, Grouping,
   Subqueries, Joins)
 - Github ( Project documentation)

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION

 - The data set was first reviewd and cleaned in Excel, where duplicate

   reccords were checked and none was found, the file was saved to CSV

   UTF-8 Format.

 - A new database was created in SQL Server Management Studio(SSMD)
  
   using SQL querries, after which the cleaned Excel file was imported.

 - During the import process appropriate data type were assigned to
  
   columns as needed. NULL values were permitted for three specific

   columns to preserve data integrity and flexibility during querries.

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

  The Kultra Mega stores inventory Dataset was explore(Structured Querry
  
  Language) to answer and draw insights from some questions such as:

  case scenerios 1: Sales and regional performance

   - which product category has the highest sales?
   - what are the top 3 and bottom 3 regions by total sales
   - What are the total sales of appliance in Ontario>
   - Which shipping method incurred the highest cost?
   - What strategies can improve revenue from the bottom 10 customers?

Case scenerio 2: Customer profitability and operational insights

  - Who are the most valuable customer and what do they purchase?
  - Which small business customer had the highest sales?
  - Which coperate customer placed the most orders(2009-2012)?
  - Which consumer customers was the most profitable?
  - Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
  - Was shipping cost aligned with order priority?(Delivery Truck vs Express Air)

 - Question 11....

---If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and 

---Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company 

---appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? (Explain your answer)

-----Select View------

Select * From [dbo].[vw_dbokmsdboord]


SELECT  
    
    Order_Priority,  
   
    Ship_Mode,

GROUP BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode  

ORDER BY Ship_Mode, Total_Cost DESC

----Answer: Based on Order Priority				Ship Mode					Total 

Cost

-----		Low									Delivery Truck				
$1,659.14

-----		High								Delivery Truck				

$1,274.98

-----		Not	Specified						Delivery Truck				

$1,040.76

-----		Medium								Delivery Truck				

$925.25

-----		Critical							Delivery Truck				

$829.01

-----		Low									Express Air					
$289.95

-----		Not	Specified						Express Air					
$257.40

-----		Critical							Express Air					
$195.19

-----		Medium								Express Air					
$167.27

-----		High								Express Air					
$108.92

------Was shipping cost appropriately spent based on Order Priority?

----a- Appropriate spending depends on matching high-priority orders with fast (Express Air) shipping and low-priority 

orders with economical (Delivery Truck) methods.

----b- If there are mismatches (e.g., urgent items shipped via Delivery Truck), the spending is inappropriate.

----c- A proper audit of the data would confirm alignment.
